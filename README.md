webplotpy
=========
A data plotting kit - Webplotpy offers a web interface for visualizing datasets from a python script (and from command line). The idea behind webplotpy is to make the part of data-visualization and other standard plotting tasks a one or two liner operation, via effectively utilizing the most commonly available feature on our computer systems i.e. web browsers.
```python
>>> from webplotpy import line_plot
>>> data = [...]
>>> line_plot(data)
```
